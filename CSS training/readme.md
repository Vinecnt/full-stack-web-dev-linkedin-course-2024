## Getting Started
- Relative and absolute paths
  - similar to file directories
  - Don't embedded other third party website resources
    - aka hot linking
- By default images are displayed as the same size as source images size
- retina images; apple trade marked high density pixel screensg
- 
- Inline Css
  - should be used sparingly and difficult to maintain
- Internal Css
  - can use style element tag, but still bad for same reason as inline css
- external css
  - link tag, rel to style sheet, href path to css file
  - easy to manage
  - seperates from html
- Naming conventions
  - styles.css
  - name after project then append .css
## Core Concepts
- W3C spec
  - W3C
    - Responsible for CSS specification
    - Multiple levels and modules
    - levels no longer refer to versions
    - Status codes are colorized
- CSS syntax
  - Declaration block
    - contains one or more style rules enclosed in curly brackets
    - Selector
      - specifies which html element to apply style to 
  - Declarations
    - CSS Style rule
    - use property value pairs to tell
    - seperated by colon and line ends with semi colon
  - Some property have shorthand and longhand
    - ex: padding
    - long hand can be used for specifying just one of the sub properties
    - /* */ for commenting
  - White Space
    - add space between selector names
    - white space matters in shorthand
    - can also use a linter
  - CSS Property, Values, Units
    - color
      - color, hex, rgb
  - Numeric data types
    - used with or without units
  - Length
    - distance value 
    - absolute length
      - fixed based units
    - Relative Units
      - length based on a anohter element
        - em
        - vw
        - vh
  - Keywords
    - textual data types
    - predefined values
    - In the css spec
      - ex: blue, dashed
  - Functions
    - can be complex
    - start with name of function
      - ex: calc, rotate, rgb
  - Pseudo-classes
    -  keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element
    -  ex: :hover can be used to select a button when user's pointer hovers over the button
  - Pseudo-element is a keyword added to selector to style a specific part of the selected element
    -  ex: ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first paragraph line
    -  can only have one pseudo-element in a selector
    -  ex: p:hover::first-line
    -  selects the first line of a paragraph when the paragraph itself is being hovered
- Color property
  - different color values
  - keywords
    - ex: red, blue, green
    - ex: oldlace, darkslategray
      - check docs for full list
  - colours.neilorangepeel
  - rgb value functions
    - old syntax uses comma
    - new syntax comma less
  - hex values for colors
    - can even add a transparency value with additional 0 to FF
  - How to pick colors
    - canva dot com
  - Type Selectors
    - ex: body
  - Universal selectors
    - asterisk
    - becareful
- ID Selector
  - Match to single unique element
  - technically can put same id value in multiple elements, but not technically valid code
- Multiple classes
  - can have multiple class on one element
  - must be seperated by space and contained within the quotes
  - order of class names doesn't matter
- Combining Selectors
  - join the selectors with no spaces
    - styles are only applied when all classes are added to element
  ```css
  <!-- only applies if both classes pressent-->
  .big.tall {
    width: 100px
    height: 200px
  }

  <\p class="big tall">will be wide and tall</p>
  ```
- Descendant combinators and selector list
  - The DOM
    - Document object model
    - relationship between elements in html page
    - parent, child, descendant, sibling
      - like in a graph
  - selectors 
     ```
     <!-- applies in this specific order -->
     ancestor descedant {
     }
     ```
- Background property
  - background is actually shorthand for many property
  - long hand properties
    - background-color
    - background-image
    - background-no-repeat
    - background-position
      - can use box coordinates
      - also bottom center
    - background-size
      - cover stretches
- Shorthand sytnax
  - order doesn't matter
  - except when using background size
  - background size must be declared with a background-position value seperated with a slash
    - bad ex: center cover
    - good ex: center/cover
  - if no background position
    - just add background-size: cover afterwards 
  - it's a pain just use longhand
- Inheritance and cascade
  - browser read styles top to bottom
  - conflicting rules are resolved by declarations loaded last
- Specificity over rides Css rules
  - determines which CSS rule takes precedence when style conflict based on the type and number of selectors used
    - some selectors have more weight than other
    - higher specificity have more weight
  - tiers high to low
    - id
    - class
    - type
    - universal
  - Calculations
    - number of id selectors
    - number of class selectors
    - number of type selectors
    - number for each count are concatenated for a final specificity values
    - Ex: .classname p a
      - specificit = 012
      - 0 ids
      - 1 class
      - 2 type selectors
  - Inheritance
    - descendant elements will inherit styles from ancestor
    - cascade rule means last declaration will be displayed if there's a conflict
    - more specific selector will override both inheritance and the cascade
  - The over of all three
    - !important
  - overriding important requires !important with more specficity
    - bad practice 
    - avoid if can
## CSS Box Model
- 4 parts concentric parts
  - content
    - width and height
  - padding
    - length and percentage
  - border
    - border style
  - margin
    - length and percentage
- Box Sizing
  - how total width and height of element are calculated
  - content-box and border-box
  - context-box is default
    - padding and border will increases contenxt-box total size
      - margin adds space around element so not included in total size of element (still affects how much space element uses)
  - border box
    - padding and border will shrink content part to maintain overall size
      - margin not included
  - Usually easier to size elements using border-box because stays constant when messing with padding and border
  - Box Model Fix proprosed by Paul irish
    - where set html type selector to be border-box and then make everything (*,*:before,*:after) inherit the border-box styling from ancestor
- Inline and block displays
  - Block elements
    - take height of content
    - take width of container
      - that's why sequential ones takes newline
  - Inline elements
    - take height and width of content
    - displayed left to right
    - wraps around
  - display
    - property that affects default behavior of block and inline
      - block, inline, and inline-block 
    - Adding width and height to inline elements have no effect because they take up the width and height of the content
    - background color doesn't extend to the space taken by marging because margin is the space around the element by definition
    - Margin in inline elements only affect left and right sides
- Footer Style
  - Can turn a unordered llst of objects into a row of objects by
    - applying a property on an ancestor class to have no list style (list-style-type: none) and remove padding (padding: 0)
  - wrapping 
- Browser Developer Tool
  - very nice, ctrl+shift+i on chrome
  - hover of element on page and will be highlighted in editor and vice versa
  - can directly edit the css and see the padding and margins 
- Box Model quirks
  - margins overlap taking the highest of the two
  - two spans seperated by a newline in vscode will have a slight span between them in html
    - Fix 1: putting second span in class of margin-left: -4px would suffice
      - cannot put negative values in padding
    - Fix 2: put a wrapper div with a class having property font-size:0px;, but then put a type selector (which outweighs) with a font-size: 16px
- Setting background image of page
  - body has an 8px default margin?
  - set background height to 100% to stretech image to height of container
- Using negative margins
  - margins are relative
  - negative margin pulls elements from the corrsponding side
- Ceneter Aligning with Margings
  - Auto for legt and right values to cneter align block elements
  - Need add a width
    - if span across no need to cener align it
    - margin: 0 auto
      - default 8px margin on body
      - the auto adds marging width left and right of element
  - If want to center element but have background span the width of the page
    - add a container with class for background
    - add background color to the containter
- Add content wrappers
  - a general purpose class to center elements by adding margins on left and right side of elements
  - max-width makes the element go to max of this width
    - so when viewing on smaller view ports, element shrinks with small screen
    - However, can then add padding so for small view ports text won't run up again edges
- Adding header image
  - In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.
    - will need to change in property for dipslay to use block properties if want to act like block
## Layouts, Floats, Possition
- Floats
  - more popular in legac
  - normal flow
    - blocks layer on top of each other
  - Float takes elements out of the flow order
  - Content in flow order will wrap around floated image
    - Can use clear property to clear floats and not wrap around them
      - clear: both, left, right
      - clear property returns elements that follow a floated element back to the normal flow
  - When no element in same container as the float to apply clear style to, it must be applied to parent element instead
  - Overflow
    - used to clear floats
    - hidden
      - overflowed text in a box is cut off
    - auto  
      - a scroll bar is added when overflow
  - Clear Fix hack
    - in a parent class that wraps the floated elements, add ::after pseudo class so flowwing elements in that class will clear:both
  - Dipslay
    - in new formats
    - display: flow-root
      - put in parent element of floated elements
      - this way won't have to worry about floats poking out of containers
      - is nice because float elements won't spin into neighboring elements outside of parent element
- Position property
  - used to position elements by change the flow of document
    - static 
      - default
      - not positioned
      - not affected by top bottom left right properties
    - absolute
      - position:absolute
        - relative to the body element by default
        - will be offset by an amount speficied (top,bottom,left right)
        - is removed from the flow so next items will be moved to fill up it's space
        - When page scrolls it doesn't move
          - poisition only is calculated when page loads
        - Is relative to the nearest positioned element (an element with the positition property)
          - if not exist will be relative to the body
          - position relative is the onl one that doesn't break the natural flow 
    - relative
      - top: 20px
        - will be pushed "down" 20 pixels from the top of its original position
        - if bottom: 20px also exists, it will be ignored
        - if left and right properties exist, the right will be ignored
          - this ignoring rules applies to all positions
    - fixed
      - remove from normal flow
      - is relative to the view port even on page scroll
      - not affected by positioned parents or ancestor elements
    - sticky
      - Similar to relative position
      - will not result in changes until at least one offset property added
      - element stays until you scroll the page
      - when offset set value is met, it becomes fixed
      - Use it for navigation bars because it removes things from the flow
      - also personally it's reminscent of annoying ads
- Position and z index
  - elements are stacked in a stacking order if over layed
  - element with higher stack level is given higher display priority
  - By default
    - sequential elements have a natural stacking order
      - aka next element in the html covers the one behind it in terms of priority
  - z-index: 1 overides anything that doesn't have a z-index
    - though won't be override by negative z-index
## Flexbox and grid
- Grid and Flexbox
  - Flexbox 1D and Grid 2D
  - In the past float was used in web design ex: float:left, nbw we have flexbox and grid
  - flexbox
    - container: parent element
    - items: child elements
      - laid on a main axis
        - horizontal left to right by default (row)
          - can be changed top down with ```flex-direction:column```
    - axes have start and end points
      - cross start and cross end
      - main start and main end
    - Define flex container 
      - ```display: flex;``` or ```display: inline-flex```
        - ```display: flex```
          - items will by default display in row stretch to width of items' contents while flex container stretch to width of container
        - ```display: inline-flex```
          - same as display:flex but flex container stretches to width of items instead of the width of container
      - Both auto adjust content to stretch height to max height among flexbox items
- Flexbox: Orientation and order
  - flex-direction property determines direction of the main axis
    - row
      - left to right
    - column
      - top down
    - row-reverse
      - right to up
      - main start and main run flipped
      - ordering is not flipped, html itself is not changed
    - column-reverse
      - down top
    - in right to left languages, row-reverse is left to right
  - flex-wrap
    - items are arranged on a single axis by default
      - default: nowrap
        - flex items stay on the same line
        - remaining space in container will be dislayed
        - flex items will shrink when the items are larger than the flex container
      - if container is too small, content will overflow
    - flex-wrap: wrap
      - will wrap to next lne
      - remaining space will be displayed
    - flex-wrap: wrap-reverse
      - changes the direction of the wrapped items
      - only the cross start and cross end are reversed
    - short  hand flex-flow
- Sizing with flex
  - used to size items relative to their container
  - flex-grow
    - detemrines how items expand in the flex container
    - unitless number
    - 0 default
    - 1 distributes extra space to all items equally
  - flex-shrink
    - how items will shrink if they're larger than container
    - unitless number
    - 1 default
    - 0 prevents items from shrinking
  - flex-basis
    - inital size of flex item
    - length, percent, keywords values
    - default auto
      - items displayed same size as content
      - box-sizing: content box
        - aka extra content and padding will make it bigger
      - though normal want border-box so content doesn't scale out of control
  - flex
    - flex: 0 1 auto
      - order is flex grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
  - css
    - give parent container display:flex
    - give children items a class of flex: 0 1 auto
- Aligning Flex items
  - Center-aligning with Flexbox
    - justify-content aligns items on the main axis
      - the x-axis so to speak, like justify text in a word processor
    - align-items aligns flex items on the cross axis
      - the y-axis
    - set center for both properties to center horiz and vert
    - Properties can also distribute space around items
      - justify-content:
        - flex-start aligns along the main start (left side)
        - flex-send aligns along the main end (right side)
        - space-between aligns on both sides distributes remaining space evenly between items
        - space-around aligns on both sides but distributes same space around each item (will look wider in between items)
        - space-evenly aligns on both sides but distributes same space between each item and the left and right side of the first and last item respectively
    - align-items
      - stretch stretches items to meet the top and bottom of the container flex item is in. However, by default flex items already stetch to meet the height of the container
      - center reduces items heigh to its contents 
      - flex-start align items to the cross start (top)
      - flex-end aligns items to the cross end (bottom)
  - Adding padding to element extend space for clickability of an object
    - adding marging doesn't 
- CSS Grid
  - Before CSS grids, grid-brased layours were common
    - grids dividied into columns with gutters to add consistent space between them
  - CSS creates grid-based layouts with CSS
  - Defining the grid container
    - Use display with property grid or inline-grid
  - by default 
    - width of grid-items span width of container
    - width of inline-grid items span width of content
  - grid vs inline-grid
    - grid will stack ontop of other grid element
    - inline-grid will stack next other grid elements
  - grid lines divide grid into columns and rows
  - grid lines determine position of grid items using a num index or custom index
    - negative index can also reference opposite end of grid
  - grid cell
    - single unit where grid row and col intersect
  - grid track is row or column
  - can be seperated by gutter
  - grid area may span one or more grid cells and tracks
- The explicit grid
  - grid tracks can be defined in the frid container with
    - grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
  - fraction unit: fr
    - grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
      - splits a column grid with equal size
    - grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
      - split into 3 columns where second column twice size
    - repeat function
      - grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
      - as same grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    - as same grid-template-columns: 50px repeat(2, 1fr);
      - first col 50px, following two column split space remaining equally
- Implicit grid
  - grid-template-rows and columns define the explicit grid
    - once exp grid is filled or has been defined, an implicit grid will be created
      - used when don't know how many col and rows will be
  - use grid-auto-rows and columns to define implicit grid
  - this css only applies to items outside the explicit grid
- Add Gutters with gap
  - one val adds same amount of space between rows and col
  - two values, first val add to rows second val to columns
  - gap: 10 px
  - use length, calc, or percentage vales
    - no fr
    - long hand 
      - grid-row-gap
      - grid-column-gap
    - short hand
      - grid-gap
## Typography
- Typograghy for the web
  - Overall design and practice of organizing text to communicate and engage reader
  - Typeface
    - design of a set of letters, numbers, and symbols that share common design features
  - font
    - specific instance of a stype face
  - font family
    - collection of fonts
  - Comic sans
    - casualk
  - Script typeface
    - elegant feeling
    - headings
  - Decorative typefaces
    - big feeling
  - Monospace Typefaces
    - for code
  - Serif Typeface
    - traditional
    - times new roman
  - Sans serif Typeface
    - comptemporary and mordern
  - Rise in serif type faces
    - that what Medium uses
- Font-family
  - property is used to define the typeface of an element. Value is declare as a list of fonts options arranged bt priority from highest to lowest 
  - if font not installed, will try next option until available font found
  - include generic font family as last option
  - Generic font families
    - differ across browser
    - serif
    - sans-serif
    - monospace
    - cursive
      - for script or decorative fonts
    - fantasy
      - decorative fonts
    - system-ui
  - System fonts
    - can be fallback or primary font options
    - design to integrate with look and feel of user os
    - can still include fallback fonts in the stack
      - font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  - Valid font family names
    - if contains apace and numbers, should in quotes
    - generic fonts must always be unquouted
  - Websafe font
    - fonts that commonly come preinstalled
- Font weight and font style
  - font-weight: 100; light or thinnest
  - font-weight: 900; darkest 
    - keyword normal equals to 400
    - keyword bold equals to 700
      - default for heading
  - Missing weights
    - when weight is specified which no font file exists, typeface choosest closest weight
  - Font-style
    - property to define italic font
      - italic
        - created by typesetter drawn with slightly cursive style influenced by caligraphy
      - oblique
        - slantly normal
        - if no oblique font, then browser slants normal font
      - normal
        - normal font
  - Web fonts with @font-face
    - fonts can be downloaded
    - different format fonts as required by older browsers
    - woff2 maybe not be supported in legacy
    - fontsquirrel generator; watch out for license
```css
  @font-face{
    font-family: "same_name as font face";
    src: url(something.woff);
  }
  ...
  body {
    font-family: "same_name as font face", other, fonts;
  }
```
  - Online Font services
    - link to online font service
    - font.google dot com
- font-size
  - definies the size of text and be used with a variety of value types
  - pixel
    - ideal for accuracy
    - absolute value- size is fixe
    - use whole number value
      - decimal is inconsistent across browsers
    - default text is 16px 
  - em
    - named after letter m
    - relative unit
      - sized in relation to closest ancester elmenet
      - 1em is = inherected font size
      - can use whole numbers and decimals
  - rem
    - root em
    - relative unit to only the root element (html)
    - font sizing in other elements has no effect
- Font sizing and accessibility
  - header styles are set according to in font-size em
  - setting browser default font size will therefore increased heading
  - relative units
    - em
    - rem usually easier to maintain consistent because relative to root element
    - Design mock ups are usually in pixels
  - can convert pixels to rem which conversion 16px /16px = 1rem if browser default is 16px
  - 62.5% Method
    - popular font sizing by Richard Rutteer
    - 62.5% of 16 is 10
    - Math is easier
    - set root element to font-size: 62.5% and body 1.6 rem
    - Makes designs easier while respecting user preferences
    - Image if business user case requires one body 20px and other body 30px
    - Then with html set to font-size set to 62.5%, then the setting body to 2.0rem and the other body 3.0rem satisfies the requirement while making math easier
- text-align text-transform
  - text-align
    - used to align content with a block elmeent. Inheritable style and defined using keywords
    - also applies to image element
    - center
      - centers element
    - left
      - starts left
    - start
      - refers to language
      - so english similar to left
    - right
      - starts right
    - justify
      - similar to newspaper
    - doesn't really work with span since span limits width to ocntent
  - text-transform
    - control capitalizaiton of text
    - capitalize
      - sets first letter of each word to upper case
- Line height and letter-spacing
  - line height
    - sets the vert spacing between lines of text 
    - used with length, number, percent and keyworld normal
  - letter spacing
    - set horiz space between text characters/lines
  - line height
    - if value is same as font size, no spacing
    - if smaller than font size, characters over light
    - 150% is 1.5 times the font size
    - By default browser is roughly 1.2
  - letter spacing
    - positive value spaces character apart
    - negative brings together
    - 0.05em; relative is usually better/cleaner
## Layouts: Fluid and Responsive
- Intro to responsive Designs
  - Opera Mini Browser 2005 Mobile browser
  - 2009 Responsive Web Design
    - Ethan Marcotte
- Intro to media queries
  - Media queries
    - selectively apply CSS rules
    - start with @media
      - ex: @media screen and (max-width:600px)
  - print matches to printers and print-related displays
    - screen matches to devices with a screen
    - all matches to all devices; default
  - Media features
    - test for specific feature of the brwoser or device
    - media feature
      - (max-width: 650px)
    - test for height, colors, orientation and more
  - Media feature: width
    - typical to test
    - Qused to test the width of theviewport
    - used with max and min with
    - used with logical operators
  - logical operators in media feature
    - and, or, not
  - All CSS must be conatined withing the curly brackets
    - css ignored other
  - Where to put
    - put underneath corresponding css
    - group and but at bottom
    - put in seperate css file
    - put in link
- Breakpoints and media queries
  - breakpoint is the point where media querty is introduced to make css changes when speciifc condition is true
    - often width or specific viewport of screen
  - early rwd used breakpoints target specific devices
    - statcounter for common resolutions
  - Most common is for rwd is to choose breakpoints where design and layout starts to break rather than focus on specific devices
  - media feature:wdith
  - @media (min-width: 960px)
    - width: 960px exact
  - To prevent min-width and max-width from overlapping, make one slight lower or higher 
  - When to use max or min width
  - Desktop centric first
    - use max-width queries
  - Mobile first
    - min-width queries first
  - Can combine both to make a range
    - (min-width: 400) and (max-width: 800px)
- Fluid layouts
  - do we always need media queries?
  - fluid layouts and flexible images may make media queries unnecessary if screen is fluid enough
  - Flexbox is flexible sizing
  - height of browser is not fixed, and squeeze and stretch
  - Use grid for fleixble sizing
  - Flexible images
    - background-size: cover
      - relative to viewport
- Viewport meta tag
  - mobile in past and today would zoom down 
  - RWD wold need to disable the scaling so optimized styyle display as intended
    - do so by giving browser about the viewport
    - meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" initial-scale=1
    - viewport, device wdith, page is not scaled when loaded
- Testing responsive layouts
  - in developer tools can change resolution
