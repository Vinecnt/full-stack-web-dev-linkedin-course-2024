## HTML
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
## HTML elements
  - tags
    - \<q\> vs \<blockcontent\>
      - inline vs block level element
    - \<i\> vs \<em\>
      - italic vs emphasis
    - \<b\> vs \<strong\>
      - bold vs strong importantance
    - \<time\>
      - denotes time
      - datetime attribute to allow program to parse the time regardless of the text actually between the tags
    - \<code\>
      - to write about code. Text put inside tags are just displayed as browser default monospace font. Better off using css
    - html entities
      - for html reserved character (Ex: &lt to represent <)
      - Starts with & and ends with ;
      - \&nbsp; non breaking space where browser won't break line here
    - \<br\> 
      - line break
    - \<pre\>
      - makes browser acknowledge spacing between lines and words within tag
    - Subscript, Superscript, small text
      - \<sup\>, \<sub\>, <small> for small meaning (Ex: copyright or fine print)
## HTML Properties
  - Browser Inspector
  - Aria accesibility
  - tags can have attributes
  - \<!-- --\> for commenting
## Links and Navigation
  - Links
    - \<a> tag anchor and href attribute is a the hypertext reference defines the linK
    - hrefs ideally include http; sometimes browser can fill in
    - HTTPS means communication will be secure/encrypted 
  - URL Path
    - Absolute Url
    - Relative Url
      - can point to images,gifs,html files
      - navigates folder like
    - Folder paths actually look for a index.html file under the folder
      - website.com/page is the same as website.com/page/index.html is the same as website.com/page/
  - Navigation
    - \<nav> though needs css to actually look good, implies this block is for navgiation on the website
    - \<footer> implies block is the footer of the page like in a book
## Images
  - Images
    - \<img> tag
    - alt attribute for alternative text when image won't load
    - width and height attributes refer to pixels
      - lets website precalculate the size for loading so elements don't jump around  
  - Image formats
    - Constant battle of aiming for high quality and small file size
    - .gif
      - oldest, 256 colors, can be transparent, good for large areas of a single color
    - .svg
      - vector file, instructions for drawing
      - complex drawings
      - can be scaled big or small without loss of quality
    - .jpg
      - compressing photos
    - .png
      - good for compression, photos, and transparency 
  - Responsive Images
    - Deliver different image files for different sized screens
    - Create multiple copies of images at different resolutions
    - srcset attribute to point to multiple images
  - Responsive width
    - choose images based in viewport width
    - size attribute to specify breakpoints to which image to pick
  - Responsive pictures
    - \<picture> tag
    - Want to use different pictures for different size devices
    - \<source> tag uses \<srcset>
    - though lot of work to do manually, libaries and frameworks typically just have you upload the one large version
  - Figue and Figcaption
    - \<Figcaption>
      - To Caption figures
    - \<Figure>
      - For figures and photos
    - Search engines use the two elements good for seo 
## Media
  - Audio
    - \<audio>\</audio>
    - uses src attribute
    - controls attribute existing will use browser playing
    - loop causes to play again
    - autoplay causes to autplay
    - has closing tag to support multiple sources
    - mp3 is primary format
    - Can supply resilient text
  - Video
    - \<video>\</video>
    - H.264 has highest support across browser
      - not open source
      - perhaps WebM or avi1 will win out in the future
    - Can have multiple source attributes
      - plays first working source
      - nothing in html lets you control the resolution video plays at; app like netflix make something adaptive bitrate streaming; usually embed video streamer
  - Captions and subtitle
    - ```<track>```
    - supply captions source, kind, label, srclang
    - could make kind="descriptions"
      - video more accesible to blind or hearing impaired
    - Chapter division in VTT
  - Embedding other media through iframes
    - take content from another website and put it in right in the website
    - typically get the html from service you're using
    - typically is an iframe
      - watch out for security because supplied by 3rd party
## More Ways to identify content
- Languages
  - lang="en-US" in \<html>\</html>
  - affects spell checkers
  - universal attribute
    - can put anywhere, divs and spans
  - dir universal attribute to show what direction text flows
  - charset attribute
    - ASCII 128 character for english
    - Unicode giant UTF-8 spec
      - try to support all languages
    - ```<meta><meta>``` charset="UTF-8"
- Generic elements div and span
  - when no other elements make sense
  - Value of semantic blocks
    - could technically make everything out of divs but it's bad and hard to read
  - div 
    - block level element
  - span 
    - inline
  - both do nothing until css specifies
  - global attributes
    - ex: class, id, lang, aria roles
## HTML page
- HTML page
  - works by
    - user visits a url
      - sends a get reset
    - Web server sends back one html file
    - Browser reads the html file top to bottom
    - usually the top of the web page contain more files for the browser to head (css, scripts)
  - Html file structure
    - top of doc must contain
      - doctype declaration
        - declares which era html file is from
      - html tag with language and dir
        - iniside, head
          - contains the metadata not displayed
        - then body
          - contains stuff displays
- document head
  - meta only used in the head tag
    - tell browser is responsive page
      - viewport
    - description
  - title tag is used by the browser
    - name in tab and bookmark
  - link element
    - link to other css
  - rel
    - tell what browl
  - href is url to webiste
  - script tag
    - load javascript file
    - technically can put script tag at bottom
- Structure Content in body
  - main
    - once per webpage
  - header and footer (like in a book page)
    - don't confused with head
    - again all semantic meanings
  - Article
    - wrap around article snippet
    - just mean this thing is a unit of content
  - Section
    - wrap around sections of content
    - or zones
    - flexible element
  - Aside
    - marks off to the side or side bar
    - inset panel
    - perhaps advertisement
- Putting together Html together is like an art, refer to other good sites
## Forms
- Basic forms
  - how to interact with browser
  - ```<form></form>``` element
  - label attribute
  - input element
    - is a replaced element
      - browser loads the code itself
  - button element
  - action attribute; get method not a good idea

  - connect label and input field
    - wrap label around input
    - both set for tag to same value
- Form complex actions
  - type attribute to input
  - type attribute set to email

    - date
    - color
    - file
    - checkbox
      - has attribute checked
    - radio
## HTML Tables
- When to use a table
  - Don't misuse html tables with non table things
    - don't use a table for a button
  - one special note is html email; better formats aren't really supported
  - tabular data; data is organized in rows and columns where data relays both
    - does a table make data more sense
- Table tags
  - \<table>
    - wraps whole table
  - \<tr>
    - table row
  - \<th>
    - table header
    - column header
  - \<td>
    - actual table data
  - put \<th> in first \<tr> row
